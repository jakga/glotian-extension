## Introduction

Glotian ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Glotian Chrome Extension collects, uses, stores, and shares your information.

**Key Principles**:

- **Privacy-First**: On-device AI processing means your data never leaves your computer when possible
- **Transparency**: We clearly explain what data we collect and why
- **User Control**: You control what gets synced and can delete all data anytime
- **No Tracking**: We don't collect browsing history, cookies, or personal identifiers for advertising

---

## Data Storage & Security

### Local Storage (On Your Device)

**IndexedDB** (~50MB quota):

- Cached notes, flashcards, and decks
- Sync queue (offline changes waiting to sync)
- Activity log (last 1,000 actions)

**chrome.storage.local** (~5MB quota):

- User preferences and settings
- Supabase session token (signed JWT, stored in browser-isolated storage)
- AI support cache

**Security Measures**:

- Session tokens are signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using asymmetric algorithms (RS256/ES256)
- Tokens are stored in Chrome's isolated storage (`chrome.storage.local`) protected by Chrome's sandbox
- Access tokens are short-lived (default: 1 hour expiration) to minimize exposure window
- All communication with Supabase uses TLS 1.2+ encryption with modern cipher suites
- LRU eviction prevents quota overflow
- Data is isolated per Chrome profile

### Remote Storage (Supabase)

**What Gets Synced** (Opt-in):

- Learning notes you explicitly save
- Flashcards and decks you create
- Study progress and statistics
- User preferences (for cross-device sync)

**What Stays Local**:

- Activity log (not synced)
- Error logs (unless you opt-in to Sentry)
- Temporary cache and drafts

**Supabase Security**:

- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all customer data in the PostgreSQL database
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ with modern cipher suites (e.g., TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)
- **Authentication**: Passwords are salted and hashed with bcrypt using unique per-password salts, and bcrypt is one-way so hashes cannot be reversed to recover the original password
- **Session Tokens**: Signed using asymmetric algorithms (RS256 or ES256 per JWKS endpoint)
- **Key Rotation**: JWT signing keys rotated annually (minimum); see https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/signing-keys
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: You can only access your own data via enforced database policies
- **SOC 2 Type 2 Certified**: Compliance for secure handling of customer data
- **ISO 27001 Certified**: Information security management system certification
- **HIPAA Compliant**: Business Associate Agreement (BAA) available for regulated data
- **Security Audits**: Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- **Vault Encryption**: Sensitive secrets encrypted with authenticated encryption (AEAD via libsodium)
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/shared-responsibility-model for details

**Security Model & Threat Assumptions**:

The extension's security architecture is designed to protect your data under normal operating conditions. Please note:

- **Device Integrity Assumption**: Security relies on your device being free from malware and unauthorized physical access
- **Browser-Stored Tokens**: Session tokens stored in `chrome.storage.local` are accessible to:
  - The Glotian extension itself
  - Other extensions with broad permissions
  - Malware with file system access
  - Users with physical device access
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Access tokens expire after 1 hour (configurable) to limit exposure window
  - Refresh tokens are single-use and require authentication to obtain
  - You can revoke sessions remotely via Supabase dashboard
  - Enable full-disk encryption on your device for defense-in-depth protection
  - Keep your browser and OS updated with security patches
- **For Sensitive Environments**: If you work with highly confidential data, consider:
  - Using incognito mode (data not persisted after window close)
  - Disabling sync (notes stored locally only)
  - Running the extension in an isolated browser profile
- **Industry Standard**: This security model is standard for browser-based applications and aligns with OWASP guidelines (see https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)

**Data Retention**:

- Your data is stored indefinitely until you delete it
- No automatic deletion (you control your data)
- **Account Deletion Timeline**:
  - Immediate: All user account records and linked data are marked for deletion in the primary database
  - 30-day grace period: Data remains in a soft-deleted state in case of accidental deletion
  - Within 30 days: Users may request immediate permanent deletion by contacting privacy@glotian.app
  - After 30 days: All soft-deleted data is permanently purged from all backups and recovery systems
  - Recovery: Users can request data recovery within the 30-day window by contacting support
  - Note: Supabase automatic backups may contain data for up to 30 days after deletion per their retention policy

## Chrome Permissions Explained

### Why We Need Broad Permissions

**`<all_urls>` (Read and change all your data on all websites)**:

- **What We Do**: Capture text you explicitly select, inject writing coach overlay

- **Why Broad**: We can't predict which websites you'll use for learning

**`storage`**:

- Store notes and preferences locally (IndexedDB, chrome.storage.local)
- Enable offline access to your learning content

**`contextMenus`**:

- Add "Save to Glotian" right-click option

**`sidePanel`**:

- Display the main Glotian interface (non-invasive UI)

**`alarms`**:

- Periodic sync every 5 minutes (only when online)

**`tabs`**:

- Detect active tab for page summarization and Q&A

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with a new "Last Updated" date.

**Material Changes**: If we make significant changes (e.g., new third-party services), we will notify you via:
